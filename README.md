# One idea per paper    

This is a collection of ideas extrapolated from papers I read. 
The idea of this collection is to collect more papers into a very 
concise manner by selecting only a single idea per paper and/or a collection of
empirical facts. Therefore, I focus only on the
clearest of the ideas and try to discuss it in a more detailed and meaningful
manner in order to further grok it. 

Personal opinions and remarks are added and formatted as an aside note.
